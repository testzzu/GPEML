## 1.1 Goals and Duties

- **Promote GPEML in China**: Promote Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Machine Learning in China (including Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, etc.)
- **Advance research and applications**: Promote and enhance research and applications of GPEML in China
- **Foster international collaborations**: Promote international collaborations between Chinese GPEML researchers and innovative researchers worldwide
- **Develop young researchers**: Develop postgraduate research students and early career researchers to undertake research and applications in GPEML
- **Workshop branding**: Establish and update/review the name of the annual workshop (with the possibility to expand it to a conference in the future)
- **Venue and schedule**: Determine the venue and dates of each workshop
- **Programme approval**: Discuss and approve the draft programme proposed by the organizing committee, including invited speakers of the workshop
- **Format review**: Periodically review the workshop format (e.g., invited-speakers-only, paper submissions, student presentations) to ensure effectiveness and alignment with goals
- **Special issues**: Facilitate the organisation of special issues derived from the workshop
- **Book publication**: Facilitate the organisation of publishing a book in the *Genetic and Evolutionary Computation* Springer Book Series

## 1.2 Scope

GPEML focuses on research and applications of Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Machine Learning, with the following major aspects:

- **Genetic Programming (GP)**  
  Including all paradigms and representations of GP such as TGP, LGP, Grammar Guided GP (G3P), Cartesian GP, and any other evolutionary computation paradigms that can evolve non-predefined models; covering both theories and applications of GP.

- **Evolutionary Machine Learning (EML)**  
  Including using any evolutionary computation methods and techniques to help solve any machine learning tasks, and using machine learning methods to help solve or improve any evolutionary computation methods and applications.

- **Hybridisation with Generative AI / LLMs**  
  Encouraging the hybridization of EML methods and generative AI / large language models (LLMs).

In particular, this workshop aims to distinguish itself from existing Evolutionary Computation conferences and workshops.  
Pure optimisation methods and applications, e.g., EC for numeric continuous optimisation tested only on benchmarks, are considered beyond the scope of this workshop.

## 3. Workshop Organisation

### Time

To achieve the main goals of the workshop, the preferred timeframe is July–September each year.

### Organisation

The Steering Committee appoints a (General) Chair for the workshop each year. The Chair forms a local organising committee to run the event. The immediate past workshop chair and the chair-elect (immediate next chair) can serve as deputy chairs to help with the organisation. The conveners serve as the Advisory Board, helping seek, recommend, and contact international speakers. The Workshop (General) Chair leads the operational delivery to ensure the workshop runs smoothly and meets its goals, including securing sponsorship to keep the workshop financially viable.

### Invited Speakers

Each workshop will invite a number of international and national innovative researchers in GP and EML.

## 4. Meetings

The Steering Committee meets two to three times per year. The main in-person meeting is held during the workshop, ideally on the first day of registration before the workshop opening. The other meetings are organised virtually (Zoom/Teams/Tencent/Voov), including one around December/January to review progress for the next workshop and another around May/June to help the organisers finalise the programme.
