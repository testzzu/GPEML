## Welcome to GPEML 2025

GPEML 2025 focuses on the cutting-edge theories and applications of Genetic Programming (GP) and Evolutionary Machine Learning (EML). With the rapid advancement of computational intelligence, GP and EML have demonstrated tremendous potential in automated program generation, feature engineering, explainable AI, evolutionary deep learning, and other emerging fields. The symposium will gather leading experts and scholars worldwide to discuss the latest research advances, key technologies, and practical applications of GP and EML.

GPEML 2025 will take place fully in person. The Program Committee invites original, substantial, and unpublished technical papers on all areas of Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Machine Learning.
