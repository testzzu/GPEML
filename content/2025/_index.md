## Welcome to GPEML 2025

This event focuses on the cutting-edge theories and applications of Genetic Programming 
(GP) and Evolutionary Machine Learning (EML). With the rapid advancement of computational 
intelligence, GP and EML have demonstrated tremendous potential in automated program 
generation, feature engineering, explainable AI, evolutionary deep learning, and other emerging 
fields. The forum will gather leading experts and scholars worldwide to discuss the latest 
research advances, key technologies, and practical applications of GP and EML.
