## About the Symposium

The Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Machine Learning (GPEML) Symposium is a cross-disciplinary forum dedicated to automated program generation, evolutionary deep learning, and explainable AI. Each edition gathers researchers, practitioners, and students to exchange breakthroughs that push GP and EML into new scientific and industrial domains. The symposium format mirrors other flagship computational intelligence meetings by offering keynotes, paper presentations, tutorials, and networking lounges for collaborators worldwide.

## Scope

GPEML focuses on research and applications of Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Machine Learning, with the following major aspects:

- **Genetic Programming (GP)**  
  Including all paradigms and representations of GP such as TGP, LGP, Grammar Guided GP (G3P), Cartesian GP, and any other evolutionary computation paradigms that can evolve non-predefined models; covering both theories and applications of GP.

- **Evolutionary Machine Learning (EML)**  
  Including using any evolutionary computation methods and techniques to help solve any machine learning tasks, and using machine learning methods to help solve or improve any evolutionary computation methods and applications.

- **Hybridisation with Generative AI / LLMs**  
  Encouraging the hybridization of EML methods and generative AI / large language models (LLMs).

In particular, this workshop aims to distinguish itself from existing Evolutionary Computation symposia and workshops.  
Pure optimisation methods and applications, e.g., EC for numeric continuous optimisation tested only on benchmarks, are considered beyond the scope of this workshop.
